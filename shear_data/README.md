# Shear Data Subset

This folder contains shear-test datasets and MATLAB import helpers grouped by surface condition (`dull`, `shiny`) and specimen runs.

## Structure

- `dull/` and `shiny/` contain replicate runs
- `import*.m` scripts load corresponding test sets
- per-test folders contain `filtered.dat`, `specimen.dat`, and instrument metadata exports
